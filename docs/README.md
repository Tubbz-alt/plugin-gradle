# Gradle Plugin

This plugin allows you to execute gradle tasks in a configurable environment, reproduceable in different set-ups, such as: a development machine or a CI server. It also supports out of the box integration with an Android environment (e.g. Android Virtual Devices, etc); you can use it with local or remote devices.

To find out more about on how to manage Android devices using Athena refer to [Athena AVD Plugin](https://github.com/athena-oss/plugin-avd) or how to use Appium for running functional tests [Athena Appium Plugin](https://github.com/athena-oss/plugin-appium) for Android projects.
